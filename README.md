# Contact App for External Users

We tested the cross platform development framework flutter
to evaluate it for a customer project.
Objective was to create an app with the least possible amount of
native code.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](http://flutter.io/).

## The Result

We developed a contact app with the contact information of all
comSysto employees without the need to save all to the mobile
phones contact list.

With the help of the build-in material widgets, the result is a
nice to look at, well working application following
the rules of material design and android and iOS native usability.
For privacy reasons all the actual contact information has been replaced
with dummy data.
